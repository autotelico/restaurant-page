# restaurant-page
Webpack-based restaurant page. Used npm, loaders, and source mappers.

All browsers' default styles were completely reset with the Meyer Reset. The website will look the same across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and all others.

# How it works
Since the focus was to learn how to use npm and Webpack for this project, everything is pretty intuitive.

There are three tabs: Home, Menu, Contact. You are taken to Home first.

You can select each of the tabs, and whenever a tab is clicked, its content will appear.
